# PLS
## Partial least squares regression
 This procedure estimates partial least squares (PLS, also known as "projection to latent structure") regression models. PLS is a predictive technique that is an alternative to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, canonical correlation, or structural equation modeling, and it is particularly useful when predictor variables are highly correlated or when the number of predictors exceeds the number of cases.
