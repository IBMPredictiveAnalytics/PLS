Summary: Partial least squares regression
Description: This procedure estimates partial least squares (PLS, also
  known as "projection to latent structure") regression models. PLS is
  a predictive technique that is an alternative to ordinary least squa
 res (OLS) regression, canonical correlation, or structural equation m
 odeling, and it is particularly useful when predictor variables are h
 ighly correlated or when the number of predictors exceeds the number 
 of cases.
